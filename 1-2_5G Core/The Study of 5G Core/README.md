### 1.2. Difference Between 5G Network and 5GC Network Architechture
<div class="text-justify">
    
The 5G network consists of two primary components: the 5G access network (5G-AN) and the 5G core network (5GC). The 5G core network, also known as 5GC, is a key part of the 5G system and enables advanced functionality. It is based on a cloud-aligned, service-based architecture (SBA) that supports authentication, security, session management, and aggregation of traffic from connected devices. The 5G core emphasizes virtualization and cloud-native software design, allowing for greater flexibility and decentralization of network functions. On the other hand, the ordinary 5G network, which includes the 5G access network, is responsible for connecting user equipment (UE) to the core network and providing access to 5G services. It is important to note that the 5G core network is a fundamental part of the 5G system, enabling the advanced capabilities of 5G, while the ordinary 5G network encompasses the access network and user equipment, facilitating connectivity and access to 5G services.
For a more detailed comparison, the 5G core network (5GC) architecture differs from the ordinary 5G network in the following ways:
* **Service-Based Architecture (SBA)**: The 5GC is based on a cloud-aligned, service-based architecture (SBA) that spans across all 5G functions and interactions, emphasizing modularity, reusability, and virtualized software functions deployed using the MEC (Multi-Access Edge Computing) infrastructure.
* **Virtualization and Cloud-Native Design**: The 5GC leverages virtualization and cloud-native software design at unprecedented levels, allowing for greater flexibility, decentralization of network functions, and the ability to run independently on off-the-shelf server hardware.
* **Network Slicing**: The 5GC enables network slicing, allowing for the creation of multiple logical "slices" of functionality optimized for specific applications, such as high bandwidth, low latency, or massive IoT (Internet of Things) devices.
